# dat250-spring-counter-todos

The test suite (**TodoControllerTest**) should run after your implementation (see badge below). You are not allowed to change the test class!

[![TodoControllerTest](../../actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/main.yml)

Check the tab **Actions** in GitHub for more information and to initially activate the workflow run.

**Careful:** The test class sends POST-Request to create TODOs without ids and expects the single created TODO to return with an id!
